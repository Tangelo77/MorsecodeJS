How to use 
This is a very good application preferable for people with blindness or any eye dieseases, which limts their reading. For this application
to be used well we suggest atleast two users, one being the typer(input) and other being the person with blindness(listener). It is preferable
for the listener to know morse code in order to use this application to its fullest. If the listener does not morse code it is highly suggested
to teach them using the link below.
(Hyperlink)
IT IS PREFEREED FOR THE LISTENER TO USE A PAIR OF HEADPHONES OR EARPHONES FOR BETTER SOUND QUALITY.
